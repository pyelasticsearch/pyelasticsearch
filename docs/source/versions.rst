0.3.1
  * Fix ``pip install`` error.

0.3
  Backward-incompatible changes:

  * Tweak ``search()`` and ``count()`` APIs. Now each simply takes either a
    textual or a dict query as its first argument. There's no more silliness
    about needing to use either a ``q`` or a ``body`` kwarg.
  * Standardize on the singular for the names of ``index`` and ``doc_type``
    kwargs. It's not always obvious whether an ES API allows for multiple
    indexes. This was leading me to have to look aside to the docs to determine
    whether the kwarg was called ``index`` or ``indexes``. Using the singular
    everywhere will result in fewer doc lookups, especially for the common case
    of a single index.

  Other changes:
  
  * Add beginnings of Sphinx documentation.

0.2.1
  * Recognize and convert datetimes and dates in pass-through kwargs. This is
    useful for ``timeout``.

0.2
  Pretty much a rewrite by Erik Rose

  Backward-incompatible changes:

  * Rethink error handling:

    * Raise a more specific exception for HTTP error codes so callers can catch
      it without examining a string.
    * Catch non-JSON responses properly, and raise the more specific
      `NonJsonResponseError` instead of the generic `ElasticSearchError`.
    * Remove mentions of nonexistent exception types that would cause crashes
      in their `except` clauses.
    * Crash harder if JSON encoding fails: that always indicates a bug in
      pyelasticsearch.
    * Remove the ill-defined `ElasticSearchError`.
    * Raise `ConnectionError` rather than `ElasticSearchError` if we can't
      connect to a node (and we're out of auto-retries).
    * Raise `ValueError` rather than `ElasticSearchError` if no documents are
      passed to `bulk_index`.
    * All exceptions are now more introspectable, because they don't
      immediately mash all the context down into a string. For example, you can
      recover the unmolested response object from `ElasticHttpError`.
    * Removed `quiet` kwarg, meaning we always expose errors.
  * Rename `morelikethis` to `more_like_this` for consistency with other
    methods.
  * ``index()`` now takes ``(index, doc_type, doc)`` rather than ``(doc, index,
    doc_type)``, for consistency with ``bulk_index()`` and other methods.
  * Similarly, ``put_mapping()`` now takes ``(index, doc_type, mapping)``
    rather than ``(doc_type, mapping, index)``.
  * To prevent callers from accidentally destroying large amounts of data...

    * ``delete()`` no longerdeletes all documents of a doctype when no ID is
      specified; use ``delete_all()`` instead.
    * ``delete_index()`` no longer deletes all indexes when none are given; use
      ``delete_all_indexes()`` instead.
    * ``update_settings()`` no longer updates the settings of all indexes when
      none are specified; use ``update_all_settings()`` instead.
  * ``search()`` and ``count()`` no longer take the query-string-dwelling query
    (if any) as an arg; it now goes in the ``q`` kwarg, which mirrors how ES
    itself takes it. This means callers no longer have to pass an empty string
    as the first arg when they want to use a JSON query (a common case).
  * ``setup_logging()`` is gone. If you want to configure logging, use the
    logging module's usual ways. We still log to the "pyelasticsearch" named
    logger.

  Other changes:

  * Add load-balancing across multiple nodes.
  * Add failover in the case where a node doesn't respond.
  * Add `close_index`, `open_index`, `update_settings`, `health`.
  * Support passing arbitrary kwargs through to the ES query string. Known ones
    are taken verbatim; unanticipated ones need an "\es_" prefix to guarantee
    forward compatibility.
  * Automatically convert `datetime` objects when encoding JSON.
  * In routines that can take either one or many indexes, don't require the
    caller to wrap a single index name in a list.
  * Many other internal improvements
