    A thread-safe bucket of servers (or other things) that may have downtime.

    Tries to return a "live" server from the bucket on request, retiring "dead"
    servers for a time to give them a chance to recover before offering them
    again.

    Actually testing whether an server is dead is expressly outside the scope
    of this class (for decoupling) and outside the period of its lock (since it
    could take a long time). Thus, we explicitly embrace the race condition
    where 2 threads are testing a server simultaneously, get different
    results, and call ``mark_dead`` and then ``mark_live`` fairly close
    together. It's not at all clear which is the correct state in that case, so
    we just let the winner win. If flapping is a common case, we could add flap
    detection later and class flappers as failures, immune to ``mark_live``.
